Instructions

Preheat oven to 180C/350F (all oven types). Butter 2 x 21cm / 8" round cake pans (sides and base) and dust with cocoa powder.
Sift the Dry Ingredients and whisk to combine in a bowl.
Place butter and sugar in a bowl and beat with electric beater or in stand mixer until smooth and well combined (use paddle attachment if using stand mixer).
Add eggs, one at a time, beating in between to combine. At first it will look curdle - keep beating until it's smooth.
Add vegetable oil, vinegar, vanilla, buttermilk and red food colouring. Beat until combined and smooth (Note 5).
Add Dry Ingredients. Beat until just combined - some small lumps is ok, that's better than over mixing.
Divide batter between cake pans. Bake for 25 - 30 minutes on the same shelf, or until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean. (Note 6)
Rest for 10 minutes in the pan then turn out onto a cooling rack and allow to cool.
